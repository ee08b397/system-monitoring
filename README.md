Distributed Real Time Stream Monitoring System
=================

Distributed Real Time Stream Monitoring System is an on going project. Its goal is to
design and implement a distributed monitoring system to conduct the continuous monitoring over the
computer clusters. This system is design to be in the master/slave mode with two types of slaves: the
monitor and collector. The monitor is used to be deployed into the monitored computer node and the
collector is used to gather the monitored data. Besides the monitoring, we also intend to add the stream
continuous query and the data stream mining modules to the system.
